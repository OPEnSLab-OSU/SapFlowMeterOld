# Introduction
The OPENs Sapflow sensor is composed of three components, the heater probe, sensors probe, and the logging core. Depending on sensing method you choose to use (HRM or TDM) you will use two sensor probes and either one independent heater probe, or add heating elements to one of the sensor probes. These probes are then connected to the logging core, which controls the heating pulses, and reads the sensor values after a sufficient amount of time has passed, allowing the heat pulse to travel either aided or hindered by the sap flowing through the tree. Depending on how long it takes for the heat to travel, you can mathmatically determine how fast (and if using HRM, what direction) sap is flowing through the tree.
